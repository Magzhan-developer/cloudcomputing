Why do you personally review every contract clause instead of relying on templates or tools?

Let me tell you a secret about "templates."

We have beautiful templates. Our Legal department spent months drafting the perfect "Kaspi Standard Vendor Agreement." It has perfect indemnification, perfect data residency clauses, perfect liability caps. It is a work of art.

And do you know how often I get to use it?

Maybe 20% of the time.

For the other 80%—the big important contracts—I am dealing with Vendor Paper. Do you think Microsoft, or Oracle, or Salesforce, or even a medium-sized fintech provider from London is going to sign my template? No. They laugh. They say, "Here are our Master Service Terms, take it or leave it."

So I have to read their 80-page document. And their document is designed to protect them, not Kaspi. It is designed to hide risks.

And regarding "tools"...

I have tried them. I have tried the "AI contract review" tools. Do you know what they do? They look for keywords. They say, "Oh, look, there is a 'Liability' clause! Green checkmark!"

But they don't understand context.

Let me give you an example. A tool sees a clause: "Vendor shall delete Customer Data upon termination." The tool says: "Safe."

I read it and I ask: "Wait. In the definitions section on page 2, 'Customer Data' is defined as 'raw data providing by Client.' It explicitly excludes 'Derived Data' or 'Aggregated Data' generated by the Vendor's system." So if I rely on the tool, I just gave this vendor the right to keep all our transaction patterns and analytics forever. Which violates our banking secrecy laws.

The tool sees a "Deletion Clause." I see a Compliance Breach.

A tool cannot go to jail. A tool cannot be fined by the National Bank. I can.

Until a tool can sign its name next to mine and go to court for me, I will read every word myself.
