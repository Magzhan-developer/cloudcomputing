**TO:** Board of Directors, Kaspi KZ  
**FROM:** External Product Transformation Auditor  
**DATE:** 11.02.2026  
**SUBJECT:** Diagnostic of Product Operating Model Maturity

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Kaspi KZ is a **RARE DIGITAL NATIVE** in the financial services sector. The company demonstrates exceptional adherence to Marty Cagan's Product Operating Model, operating with empowered product teams (~50 dedicated teams), outcome-driven metrics (DAU/MAU at 68.7%, NPS 78), and continuous funding for persistent teams rather than project-based cycles. Evidence overwhelmingly indicates Kaspi operates as **MISSIONARIES, NOT MERCENARIES.**

**VERDICT:** This is a true Product-Led organization, not an IT Service Mode operation.

## 2. EVIDENCE OF PRODUCT-LED BEHAVIOR (NOT FEATURE FACTORY)

### A. MISSIONARIES vs. MERCENARIES: ✅ **MISSIONARIES CONFIRMED**

**Evidence from Harvard Business School Case Study & Company Statements:**
> "Any new initiative begins as a hypothesis linked to business metrics and desired changes in user behavior... The version with the best numbers, rather than the opinion of a higher-ranking manager, determines the outcome, mitigating the 'Highest Paid Person's Opinion' (HiPPO) effect."

**What this means:** Teams are empowered to solve customer problems and drive outcomes, not simply execute requirements from management. This is textbook "Product Discovery" per Cagan's TRANSFORMED framework.

**Additional Evidence:**
- **Customer-Centric Product Development:** Up to 400,000 consumers regularly surveyed to prioritize features based on potential impact on customer satisfaction (Source: Harvard case study)
- **NPS of 78:** World-class customer satisfaction score indicates focus on solving real customer problems
- **Language Used:** The company describes itself as a "technology and customer experience design company," NOT an "IT service provider" (Source: IR materials)

### B. PROJECT vs. PRODUCT FUNDING: ✅ **CONTINUOUS FUNDING CONFIRMED**

**Evidence from 2023 Annual Report (Form 20-F):**
> "Technology & product development expenses paid" amounted to KZT 50,892 million (~$112M USD) in 2023. Additionally, the company committed "KZT 20-25 billion annually over three years" for scaling infrastructure.

**What this means:** Kaspi operates with **persistent teams receiving continuous funding**, not annual project cycles. The company allocated permanent budget lines for "Technology & Product Development" as operational expenses, indicating ongoing investment in permanent product teams.

**Additional Evidence:**
- **~50 Permanent Product Teams:** Each team has dedicated leadership "responsible for specific products, fostering quick decision-making" (Source: Company statements)
- **Cross-Functional Teams:** "Directly responsible cross-functional teams combining design, UX, product development, IT, data science, finance, and legal" (Source: Harvard case study)
- **No Evidence of Project-Based Funding:** Financial statements show no line items for "Project Portfolio," "Annual Project Budget," or "Initiative-Based Funding"

### C. IT vs. PRODUCT: ✅ **INTEGRATED BUSINESS + TECHNOLOGY**

**Evidence from Management Structure (Form 20-F, 2023):**
> "Mikheil Lomtadze serving as Chairman of the Management Board (CEO)... The company emphasizes developing its own proprietary technology and leveraging data to innovate."

**What this means:** Technology is treated as a **strategic differentiator**, not a cost center. There is NO separation between "The Business" and "IT" — they are one integrated unit.

**Additional Evidence:**
- **Proprietary In-House Engineering Model:** "Proprietary product and engineering model creates defensible technological moats" (Source: Porter's Five Forces analysis)
- **Technology Leadership at Executive Level:** CEO drives technology strategy directly, not delegated to a separate CIO or "IT Department"
- **$100M R&D Investment in 2023:** Plus KZT 15 billion (~$45M) for AI/ML in 2024 — these are strategic growth investments, not back-office costs

### D. OUTPUT vs. OUTCOME: ✅ **OUTCOME METRICS CONFIRMED**

**Evidence from 3Q 2025 Earnings Materials:**

| **OUTCOME METRIC** | **VALUE** | **SOURCE** |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly Active Users (MAU) | 14.7M (FY 2024) | 3Q25 Presentation |
| Daily Active Users (DAU) | 10.1M | 3Q25 Results |
| DAU/MAU Ratio (Engagement) | 68.7% | FY 2024 Financials |
| Monthly Transactions per Active Consumer | 73 (record high, FY 2024) | Annual Report |
| MAU Retention Rate | \>88% | Company Disclosures |
| D30/D90 Retention | Primary Value Metric | Internal Documentation |
| Net Promoter Score (NPS) | 78 | Investor Materials |
| Revenue Growth (YoY) | +32% (FY 2024) | Financial Statements |

**What this means:** Success is measured by **business results** (retention, engagement, revenue per user), NOT by features shipped or on-time delivery. This is the gold standard of the Product Operating Model.

**Additional Evidence:**
- **"Data Discipline" Culture:** "Product improvements are directly tied to financial results. They manage through three layers of metrics, tracking engagement (DAU/MAU) and retention (D30/D90)" (Source: Medium article on Kaspi methodology)
- **A/B Testing Mandatory:** All releases go through A/B testing with mandatory data validation before full rollout
- **No Mention of "Features Shipped" or "Velocity" in Investor Materials:** All language focused on customer outcomes

## 3. THE "HYPOTHESIS MACHINE" — EVIDENCE OF PRODUCT DISCOVERY

**From Internal Methodologies (Medium, Harvard Case Study):**
> "Culture of Hypotheses and Fast MVPs: Any new initiative begins as a hypothesis linked to business metrics... focus on developing quick Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) within 3-6 weeks, followed by a release to a segment of the audience and mandatory A/B testing."

**This is EXACTLY what Marty Cagan describes in EMPOWERED and TRANSFORMED:**
- ✅ Start with customer/business problems (not features)
- ✅ Form testable hypotheses
- ✅ Build MVPs rapidly (3-6 weeks)
- ✅ Validate with real users (beta releases, A/B tests)
- ✅ Iterate based on data, not executive opinion

**Kaspi operates a textbook "Dual-Track Agile" model: Discovery + Delivery in parallel.**

---

## 4. POTENTIAL RISKS (MINOR)

While Kaspi is overwhelmingly Product-Led, the following warrant monitoring:

### A. **SCALE COMPLEXITY RISK**
- **Evidence:** Operating ~50 product teams across Payments, Marketplace, and Fintech platforms
- **Risk per Cagan:** At this scale, maintaining team autonomy while ensuring platform coherence requires strong Product Leadership and Architecture standards
- **Recommendation:** Ensure presence of empowered Product Architects and Platform Teams (see EMPOWERED Chapter 11)

### B. **INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION RISK**
- **Evidence:** Expanding to Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and Türkiye
- **Risk per Cagan:** Product teams in new markets may default to "copy HQ features" (mercenary behavior) rather than solving local customer problems (missionary behavior)
- **Recommendation:** Ensure international teams have discovery autonomy and local customer insight capabilities

---

## 5. THE PRESCRIPTION (FOR CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT)

Despite being Product-Led, Kaspi should focus on these areas to maintain excellence:

1. **DOUBLE DOWN ON PRODUCT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT**
   - **Why:** At ~50 teams, the company needs a pipeline of empowered Product Managers (not "backlog administrators")
   - **Action:** Implement structured Product Management coaching program aligned with SVPG principles. Ensure every PM understands Discovery vs. Delivery.

2. **FORMALIZE ARCHITECTURE GOVERNANCE FOR PLATFORM COHERENCE**
   - **Why:** Multiple teams innovating independently can create technical debt or duplicate efforts
   - **Action:** Establish an Architecture Council (NOT a command-and-control layer, but a peer review forum) to ensure platform standards while preserving team autonomy.

3. **EMBED PRODUCT DISCOVERY DISCIPLINE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS**
   - **Why:** Expansion into Türkiye, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan presents risk of reverting to "feature parity" mindset
   - **Action:** Ensure each international market has dedicated Product Discovery capacity (user research, A/B testing infrastructure), not just "localization teams."

---

## 6. CONCLUSION

**Kaspi KZ is NOT a Feature Factory. It is a rare example of a financial services company that embodies the Product Operating Model.**

The evidence is overwhelming:
- ✅ Missionaries (customer problem-solving focus)
- ✅ Continuous funding for persistent product teams
- ✅ Technology as strategic differentiator, not cost center
- ✅ Outcome metrics (engagement, retention, NPS) over output metrics

**This company should be studied as a CASE STUDY for digital transformation in traditional industries, not reformed.**

The Board's role is to **PROTECT this culture** as the company scales internationally. The primary risk is not "too much feature factory" — it's the risk of losing Product-Led discipline under pressure to "scale faster" or "standardize processes."
