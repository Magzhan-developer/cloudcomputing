# Kaspi KZ Product Operating Model Audit — Walkthrough

## Objective
Audit Kaspi KZ's organizational structure and strategy using Marty Cagan's Product Operating Model framework to determine if they operate as a "Product-Led" organization or in "IT Service Mode" (Feature Factory).

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Research Methodology
Since the local PDF files could not be directly extracted due to technical limitations, I pivoted to accessing publicly available information sources:

- **SEC Filings:** Form 20-F (Annual Report) for year ended December 31, 2023
- **Investor Relations Materials:** 3Q 2025 financial results, presentations, and press releases
- **Academic Sources:** Harvard Business School case study on Kaspi.kz
- **Industry Analysis:** Multiple sources analyzing Kaspi's organizational structure, product development methodology, and business metrics

### 2. Data Collection

Gathered comprehensive evidence across the four dimensions of Cagan's framework:

#### A. **Mercenaries vs. Missionaries**
- Cross-functional product teams (~50 teams)
- Customer-centric development (400,000+ consumers surveyed regularly)
- Focus on solving customer problems vs. executing requirements
- World-class NPS score of 78

#### B. **Project vs. Product Funding**
- Continuous funding model with persistent teams
- KZT 50.9 billion (~$112M USD) in Technology & Product Development expenses (2023)
- Multi-year commitment of KZT 20-25 billion annually for infrastructure
- No evidence of annual project-based budgeting cycles

#### C. **IT vs. Product**
- Technology treated as strategic differentiator, not cost center
- CEO-led technology strategy (no separate "IT Department")
- Significant R&D investments: $100M in 2023, KZT 15B (~$45M) for AI/ML in 2024
- Proprietary in-house engineering model

#### D. **Output vs. Outcome**
- Outcome-driven metrics tracking engagement, retention, and business results:
  - DAU/MAU ratio: 68.7%
  - Monthly transactions per user: 73 (record high)
  - MAU retention: >88%
  - D30/D90 retention as primary value metric
- Mandatory A/B testing for all releases
- Data-driven decision making (not HiPPO)

### 3. Key Discovery: "Hypothesis Machine" Methodology

Found strong evidence of Product Discovery practices:
- 3-6 week MVP cycles
- Hypothesis-driven development linked to business metrics
- Mandatory A/B testing with beta audience segments
- Data determines outcomes, not executive opinion
- Culture of rapid iteration and learning loops

This aligns perfectly with Cagan's "Dual-Track Agile" model described in EMPOWERED.

## Findings Summary

**VERDICT: Kaspi KZ is a RARE DIGITAL NATIVE — not a Feature Factory.**

The company demonstrates exceptional adherence to the Product Operating Model:

✅ **Missionaries** (customer problem-solving)  
✅ **Continuous product funding** (not project-based)  
✅ **Integrated business + technology** (not IT as cost center)  
✅ **Outcome metrics** (engagement, retention, NPS) over output metrics

## Key Insights

### What Makes Kaspi Different

1. **Customer-Centric at Scale:** Despite having 14.7M MAU, they maintain disciplined customer feedback loops (surveying 400K users regularly)

2. **Data Discipline:** Direct tie between product improvements and financial results, with three-layer metrics tracking

3. **Speed as a Habit:** 3-6 week MVP cycles with mandatory validation before full rollout

4. **Missionary Culture:** "The version with the best numbers, not the opinion of the highest-paid person, determines the outcome"

### Rare in Financial Services

Most banks and fintech companies operate with:
- ❌ Annual IT project budgets
- ❌ Separation between "Business" and "Technology"
- ❌ Success measured by features shipped or on-time delivery
- ❌ Requirements-driven development

Kaspi operates with:
- ✅ Continuous funding for persistent product teams
- ✅ CEO-led integrated technology strategy
- ✅ Success measured by customer outcomes (engagement, retention, NPS)
- ✅ Hypothesis-driven Product Discovery
